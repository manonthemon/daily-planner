## Description

I completed this project to implement skills acquired during the seventh week of EDX front-end development bootcamp. I was tasked with creating an interactive online daily planner matching the following criteria:

<li>The app should display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.</li>
 
<li>The app should Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.</li>
 
<li>The app should color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.</li>
 
<li>The app should allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.</li>

<li>An event is saved in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.</li>

<li>The events persist between refreshes of a page.</li><br>

I've included all of the above in my app. Furthermore, I coded in the following functionality:

<li>Animated, dynamically generated delete buttons appearing next to user entries, allowing them to remove list items. </li>

<li>"Clear all" button allowing the user to remove all entries.</li>

<li>A footer with copyright information and links.</li><br>

 The following screenshot presents the final look of the deployed webapp:

Creating the daily planner app allowed me to:


 <li>Practice creating code using JQUERY</li>
 <li>Practice using JavaScript libraries. I.e. Moments.js.</li>
 <li>Practice writing code in JavaScript.</li>
 <li>Practice using various DOM manipulation method to create a dynamically changing website design </li>
 <li>Practice sending and retrieving data to and from the browser's local storage</li>
 <li>Practice debugging my code.</li>
 <li>Practice GitHub workflow.</li><br>

## Installation

No installation is required. The deployed planner can be seen at https://manonthemon.github.io/daily-planner/. All project files are available in the repository. <br>

## Usage

This project can serve those wiling to learn more about using JQUERY and JavaScript to code dynamic, interactive websites. It is also a fully functional daily planner.
